# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
We have been asked to create 2 tables to analyze the current workforce. "The Number of Retiring Employees by Title", or the retiring_title table, will be created to show the number of people eligible for retirement by title.  "The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship", or mentorship_eligibility table, will show how many employees will be eligible for a mentorshop program to help employees gain the knowledge of the retiring employees.

## Results
Major points from the deliverables:
1. The retiring_title table shows that there are over 20,000 senior engineers retiring while only 1 manager is eligible for retirement.  That is a good thing as there is a greater potential to train up junior engineers to replace the senior engineers than train a great number of managers to replace the retiring manager.

2. The total number of retiring employees is 67,366 and the total number of employees eligible for the mentorship is 1,549.  That is about 2% of the retiring employees.

3. Looking at the mentorship eligbility table can be whittled down even more to show senior staff and above.  Looking it at there are other employees that may not be eligible for management included in the list.  Engineers and Staff may not be ready for management posititons as a senior engineer or senior staff would be.

4. Another table that would be useful would be looking at this information by department and who would be eligible for retirement in each department. There may be a lot of employees eligible for the mentorship program, but are they in the right departments that will have excessive vacancies due to retirement.

## Summary
There are 67,366 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins.  
There are 1549 eligible for the mentorship program.
